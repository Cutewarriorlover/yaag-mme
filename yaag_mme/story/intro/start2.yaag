    10 minutes later...{{\n\n}}A voice plays on a speaker you hadn't noticed before.{{\n\n}}"Alright players, time time to begin the first play test of Multiplayer Dungeon Runs here at Arm Attack Inc.!" says the voice on the speaker. "You will be given items upon spawning. They are one tier up from the default starting gear from the Solo game," continues the woman on the speaker. "Any questions? We can hear you, so just ask aloud," asks the woman.
