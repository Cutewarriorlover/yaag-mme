    "How about the guy in the corner?" you say.{{\n\n}}"Good idea," agrees Eevee005.{{\n\n}}You, Dino-Pack, and Eevee005 all walk up to the guy sitting down. Eevee005 speaks first.{{\n\n}}"Hi, I'm Eevee005, this is Dino-Pack, and this is {{player_name}}," she says, pointing you both out as she named you.

    "Oh, uhh, hi?" says the guy, sounding confused. "My name's MurdleMuffin. When do we start this thing?" he continued.{{\n\n}}"At twelve twenty-five," replies Eevee005.{{\n\n}}You glance at a clock. 12:15. "Damn, still ten more minutes," you think, dissapointed.{{\n\n}}"And it's nice to meet you, MurdleMuffin," added Dino-Pack.

    You can't really tell what MurdleMuffin looks like. He's wearing a black hoodie, with the hood up. You can't see his hair, so you assume it's short, if it can't be seen with the hood. Because he's sitting down, you can't tell how tall he is.{{\n\n}}"What a mysterious guy..." you think.

    "Now all there's left is the other guy," you remark, pointing to the player jumping around, apparently preparing.{{\n\n}}"Indeed. We should go say hi," says Dino-Pack.{{\n\n}}"Wait, what? I'm not going. I'll stay here for the next ten minutes," replies MurdleMuffin.{{\n\n}}"Suit yourself, we're going," responds Eevee005, and you three walk over to the last person.

    When you get near to the player, he speaks first.{{\n\n}}"Hi! My name's Tear2bad, and I'm super exited for this dungeon run! Aren't you three excited?" he rambles exitedly.{{\n\n}}"I guess I'm exited," you say.{{\n\n}}"We all are, to an extent," adds Dino-Pack.

    "Niiice. It's nice to meet you guys. What're your names?" asks Tear 2bad.{{\n\n}}"Oh, my name's Dino-Pack, this is Eevee005, and this is {{player_name}}," replies Dino-Pack, also pointing everyone out.

    As much as Tear 2bad is hopping around, you still get a good look at him. He's quite tall, being taller than Dino-Pack, even if it's a small amount. He's wearing a standard, grey, long sleeved t-shirt and jeans. He has black hair and green coloured eyes.

    "Cool, cool. Hey, hey, when do we start?" stats Tear 2bad.{{\n\n}}"Twelve twenty-five," replies Eevee005.{{\n\n}}"Nice, nice. See you then," delcares Taer 2bad, walking away.

    "That was... odd," says Dino-Pack.{{\n\n}}"Yeah, definately..." agrees Eevee005. In the distance, you could hear Tear 2bad call out.{{\n\n}}"I heard that!" he said. You, Dino-Pack, and Eevee005 look at each other.
