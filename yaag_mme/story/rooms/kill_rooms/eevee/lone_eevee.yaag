    Eevee005: lets go{{\n\n}}---Chat has ended---

    You and Eevee005 scan the room. "There has to be a way out of here somewhere," you think. Then, you notice something paculiar about the far wall. While it's all made of the same material, there appears to be a piece seperated from the rest, in the shape of a door. It's very subtle, but you decide to walk closer.

    Next to where you saw the door was a small button. You push it.

    The door indeed opens, blinding you with a white light.{{\n\n}}"nice one," pops up in chat.

    You and Eevee005 push through the light, and leave the dungeon.
