    As you regain your vision, you see a crowd of people cheering for you and the rest of your team. {{\n\n}} You notice that Dino-Pack and Eevee005 are both waving to the audience, Tear 2bad is beaming, and MurdleMuffin is quite surprised, clearly not expecting this attention.

    Then, you hear a voice. It was the same voice from the beginning of the run. {{\n\n}} “Welcome, welcome! Congratulations! My name is PSugar400. You’ve defeated the first floor of the dungeon, and we’re all excited for you! This means that the first official play test is a success! Arm Attack Inc. has successfully created a multiplayer game of Yet Another Adventure Game!” said PSugar400. The people present for the live event were going wild.

    “Now, as the audience knows, we have a special guest! The Chosen Hero, {{hero_name}}, is here today!” continued PSugar400. The audience roars with cheers while {{hero_name}} stands up. They wave and thank the crowd. {{\n\n}} {{hero_name}} glances at you and your team. You notice they take a long look at you, but they’re still smiling.

    PSugar400 continues once the crowd’s cheers die down. “But back to our team of playtesters. I think they deserve a name, what do you reckon?” The viewers in the stands agree loudly. “How about the Fighting Team?” suggests PSugar400. The audience cheers out the name.

    “Fighting Team! Fighting Team! Fighting Team! Fighting Team! Fighting Team! Fighting Team!”

    The Arm Attack Inc. Staff calm down the audience before PSugar400 keeps talking. ”Now, let’s hear a word from each member of our team. {{player_name}}, you’re up first.”

[message “{{message}},” you say.]

    “Thank you, {{player_name}}. Tear 2bad, what would you like to say to the audience?” replied PSugar400.

    “It. Was. AWESOME! I was slashing enemies and taking them down. I carried the team, really,” he answered. You, MurdleMuffin, Dino-Pack, and Eevee005 all turn to look at Tear 2bad. “Okay, well, maybe not. But still, it was great.” he corrected sheepishly.

    “Wow, what a story! So, MurdleMuffin, what do you think?” asked PSugar400.

    “It was fine, I kinda just stayed in one room for a while.” he answered simply.

    “Oh. Well, that’s okay. Dino-Pack, what do you have to say?” said PSugar400, continuing her interviews.

    “I ended up finding some really good gear. Gave some extras to other team members, actually. Fighting enemies was really fun! I’d love to do the other floors.” he told PSugar400.

    “Well, in the future, you might actually be able to do the other two!” she told Dino-Pack. The audience hollers with excitement, but PSugar400’s interview isn’t over.

    “And now, last but not least is Eevee005! What are your thoughts on the entire thing?” she asked.

    “Much like the rest of us, I enjoyed it very much. Although, If you have the ability to, the Arm Attack Inc. team should make the boss more powerful. I took down the boss by myself. I think that the entire team, if not, at least more than one person should be required to take down Mr. Dye.” she said.

    “Alright, I’ll pass that feedback on to the Development team,” replied PSugar400.

    “Thank you! And that was the Multiplayer Test for our dungeon here at Arm Attack Inc.! Thank you for being here. Once again, I’ve been your host, PSugar400, and goodnight.” finished PSugar400 before walking up to you and your team. {{\n\n}} “Tomorrow you all have meetings with {{hero_name}}. We’ve given you rooms in a nearby hotel. You all will have reps that you’ll work with. For now, follow the security team. They’ll lead you to your hotel rooms.” informed PSugar400.

    You follow PSugar400’s lead along with the rest of your team. Eventually, PSugar400 breaks off the path, and you instead follow a security team. They bring you past crowds and media press. You wave to them. You notice everyone but MurdleMuffin is doing the same. {{\n\n}} After a good 10 minutes, you arrive at your hotel room. Room 105. It’s not a very large room, but bigger than general hotel rooms. You look at the time. It’s only 3:00 PM, but you feel very tired. The bed looks very soft and comfortable. You decide to lay down, and then close your eyes, falling into a comfortable sleep.

    The end.
